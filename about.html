   <h2>Mission statement</h2>
   <h4>Spreading balance and joy through the magic of metaphysics.</h4>
   <h2>Our story...</h2>
   <p>Myrtle’s Mystic Metaphysical Shop was founded in 1989 by my beloved Aunt Myrtle Mist. After her passing I, Maggie Mist, decided to continue running her local business. We are dedicated to providing quality crystals, candles, and incense for wholesale prices. Our candles and incense are handmade, cruelty free, with natural fragrances and dyes. Our goal is to guide people through their spiritual journey by providing the tools and knowledge necessary.</p>
     <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h4>What exactly is metaphysics?</h4>
 <p>Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the abstract. Our metaphysical shop sells products that will enhance your life through a multitude of subconscious factors. Each of our products has a unique spiritual effect. Browse through our shop to find the item that will improve your life!</p>
 <h4>How do I make my candle last longer?</h4>
 <p>Avoid burning your candles for only short periods, as this will lead to tunneling and will reduce the lifetime of your candle. To make your candle last longer, try to burn your candle long enough so that the entire surface is melted. This is especially important for the first time that you burn your candle.</p>
 <h4>Are your all of your products vegan?</h4>
 <p>Yes! Everything we sell is 100% vegan, even our candles. Our specially made candles are created from a blend of natural vegetable waxes, with ingredients like soy and coconut.</p>
